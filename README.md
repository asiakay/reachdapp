# reachdapp

When you write a DApp using Reach, you ... write a program in Reach that generates a smart contract & a backend and a front-end in JavaScript, then use Reach to test and deploy it."

"Consensus networks in general, and Reach specifically, guarantee that all participants agree on the outcome of their decentralized computation." 
https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/#p_207

"Reach programs allow interaction with a user interface...
1) by allowing the frontends to provide values directly to the Reach application, and 2) by allowing the Reach program to callback to the frontend via the interact object."
https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/#p_91

"Participants in a Reach application share information with each other and find out what others have shared when... the Reach primitive publish allows a participant to share information with all other participants, which happens automatically without the other parties needing to do anything special."
https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/#p_91

"Reach programs manage token funds...
through the `pay` primitive that can be added to a `publish` primitive to send funds to the Reach program, which can then use the transfer primitive to send funds back to participants, and other addresses."
